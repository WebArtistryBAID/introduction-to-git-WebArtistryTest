Welcome to WebArtistry!

WebArtistry Learning is an integrated course for elementary web development and programming. Assuming only basic computer knowledge, this one year course teaches the basic ideas of computer science and web development in a friendly and easy-to-approach manner.

We will get started with some basic universal knowledge for developers, including usage of the terminal, version control tools like Git, and code editors. Afterwards, we will introduce basic web development tools like HTML and CSS. We will also be learning programming with Python.

Along the way, you will complete in-class exercises, labs, and projects that will hone your abilities in computer science and web development. By the end of the course, you will be fully equipped with the tools to embark on future computer science research and studies, along with the ability to create website projects from scratch. You can use your skills to join our community service projects or even start your own activities.
